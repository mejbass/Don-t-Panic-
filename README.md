"Don't Panic!" is a Python-based covert operation set in a detective noir atmosphere, guiding participants to automate the infiltration of a SQLite database and alter the administrator's password, ultimately honing their skills in cybersecurity and SQL manipulation.

## Problem Statement

You're a trained "pentester" tasked with probing and exposing vulnerabilities within a corporate data system. The objective is to automate the infiltration process, particularly targeting the alteration of the administrator's password stored in a SQLite database.

## Solution Approach

This project unfolds in a structured manner, guiding participants through Python programming and SQL manipulation. Beginning with establishing a connection to the database using the CS50 library for Python, the participant progresses towards executing SQL queries to modify critical data points, notably the administrator's password. Concepts such as prepared statements are introduced, enhancing understanding of secure coding practices and parameterized queries.

## Project Walkthrough

The project includes crafting a Python script, "hack.py," capable of seamlessly infiltrating the database, altering the administrator's password, and achieving the designated objectives of the covert operation. Additionally, provisions for testing the correctness of the implemented solution are provided, ensuring mastery of the prescribed tasks.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the provided instructions to set up the project environment.
3. Run `python hack.py` to execute the covert operation and alter the administrator's password.

## Testing

Execute the provided `check50` command to evaluate the correctness of your implementation.

## Conclusion

"Don't Panic!" serves as a comprehensive exercise, blending elements of cybersecurity, programming proficiency, and problem-solving acumen within an engaging narrative backdrop reminiscent of classic detective fiction.
